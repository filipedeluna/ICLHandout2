# ICLHandout2
Handout 2 Project

The purpose of this handout was to write a parser, interpreter and compiler for a pseudo programming language. The program uses JavaCC to build the parser and compiles to Java bytecode.

The parser, compiler and interpreter support integers, booleans, strings, structs, conditionals, loops and functions.
